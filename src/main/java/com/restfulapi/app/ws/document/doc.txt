                             ==========Service=====
         We mark beans with @Service to indicate that it’s holding the business logic.
          So there’s no any other specialty except using it in the service layer.


                                =======Entity=====
          @Entity annotation defines that a class can be mapped to a table.
          And that is it, it is just a marker, like for example Serializable interface.

          And why @Entity annotation is mandatory? ... well, it is the way how JPA is designed.
          When you create a new entity you have to do at least two things

          1. annotated it with @Entity

          2. create an id field and annotate it with @Id

     Anything else is optional, for example table name is derived from entity class name
     (and therefore @Table annotation can be optional),table's columns are derived from
     entities variables (and therefore @Column annotation can be optional), and so on ...


                            ====== @Repository=====
                   @Repository’s job is to catch persistence specific exceptions
                   and rethrow them as one of Spring’s unified unchecked exception.
